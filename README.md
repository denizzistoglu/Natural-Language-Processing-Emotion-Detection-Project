# Natural-Language-Processing-Emotion-Detection-Project

Here is my full GitHub Repository for my Natural Language Processing Emotion Detection Project. 
This project evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing approaches for emotion detection in social media text using the GoEmotions, WASSA, and Lexicon datasets.

## The repository includes:
* My Final Report detailing methodology, results, and analysis.
* All three datasets used in the project.
* Related code in both .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) and .py (Python) formats.

Implementations of:
* Data preprocessing
* Baseline models
* Classifier comparisons
* Hyperparameter optimizations
* Detailed error analysis


### Recomended environments to view and run the codes: Google Colab or Visual Studio Code 

### Install missing libraries if required: 
!pip install transformers datasets torch scikit-learn seaborn textblob 

### When prompted in the notebooks, please upload the dataset files that are already included in the repository
